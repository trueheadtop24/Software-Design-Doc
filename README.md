# Software-Design-Doc
This is a school project where I created a software design doc for a game called draw it or lose by gaming room
The project is about improving a fun game called "Draw It or Lose It" so that more people can play it. Right now, the game works well, but the goal is to make it available on the internet, so people can play it on their computers or phones. This means creating a version of the game that works in web browsers and on both Android and iPhone devices. The project will also make sure the game can handle lots of players at the same time, stays safe and secure, and works smoothly on different devices.

The game will have three main parts. First, the frontend is what players see and use, like buttons and drawings on the screen. Second, the backend is the part that makes sure the game rules are followed and keeps track of players and teams. Finally, the database is where all the important information, like player names and game scores, is stored.

How to Use the Project
Players will access the game by opening it in a web browser on their computer or mobile device. The game’s design will make sure it looks good and works well on any screen size, whether it’s a phone, tablet, or desktop computer. Players can join games, draw pictures, and guess what others are drawing, all in real time.

The game will also work across different platforms. For example, someone playing on a computer can compete with someone using a phone. Behind the scenes, the game’s backend will handle all the game rules and make sure everything runs smoothly. The database will keep all the players’ information safe and organized.

The project uses special tools to make it easier to develop and update the game. This setup ensures that the game will be fun and easy to use for everyone, no matter where or how they play.
